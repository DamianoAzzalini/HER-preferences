Source reconstruction for averaged HERs are computed based on the already computed head-models. These latter were computed based on another version of the HERs (different time-window and not averaged within each trials). 

Projection to standard template and spatial smoothing were done directly in BST interface.

The parametric test were also computed directly using BST graphical interface.
