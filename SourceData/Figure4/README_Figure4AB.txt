The file contains the Fieldtrip structure used in non-parametric statistics to determine the spatiotemporal activity encoding the contrast of the chosen option in perceptual trials. 

GA_OBJ = 	Fieldtrip structure. The field ‘individual’ contains the beta values for the contrast of the 		chosen option obtained from GLM1b. The matrix is organised Subject x channels x time. 

time 		= time (in seconds) of the significant clusters highlighted in the Figure4B. 

channels_idx 	= channels belonging to the cluster highlighted in Figure2A.
