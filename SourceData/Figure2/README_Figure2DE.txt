The file contains the fieldtrip structure used in non-parametric statistics to determine the spatiotemporal activity encoding the value of the chosen option. 

GA_SUB = Filetrip structure. The field ‘individual’ contains the beta values for the chosen subjective value obtained from GLM1. The matrix is organised Subject x channels x time. 

time 	= time (in seconds) of the significant clusters highlighted in the Figure2E. 

channels_idx = channels belonging to the cluster highlighted in Figure2D.
